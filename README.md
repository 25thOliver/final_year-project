## Bank Branch Codes
- Small project for getting bank data together with their branch details
- NB: This list is not exclusive and more data may need to be gathered and cross checked in order to provide accurate data
- **Reason behind this**: Didn't find a Central Place for finding this data. One is forced to visit the website of every bank to find the info which I find abit tiring.
- This is a hobby project and contributions are welcome

### Cloning the Project
